term in the most simplified form.
Example: For X2 + 5X + 6 = 0, you are given the input as: 1 5 6.
Write a program to find all of the roots of the quadratic.
Note: The output should be up to 2nd decimal place (round off if needed) and in case
of a recurring decimal use braces i.e. for eg: 0.33333..... => 0.33.
Note: Use Shri Dharacharya's Method to solve i.e. X = {-b + √(b² - 4ac) } / 2a & {-
b-√(b² -4ac)} / 2a
Input Description: 
Three numbers corresponding to the coefficients of x(squared), x and constant are

to “sort the even positioned elements of an array, starting from the element at index 0,
in ascending order”. Manipulate the array so as to help Loki steal the tesseract.
Input Description: 
Size of the array followed by the elements of the array
